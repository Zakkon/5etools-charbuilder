BUGS:
    - Going down in level and then up again will not re-render FOS components (seems fixed)
    - FOS subcomponents are getting their states set even after spells are renderered, even though they should be before (shouldnt be a big issue)
    - verify if url-linked spells on the sheet work for 3rd party homebrew (or your own homebrew)
    - Removing sources in use (for example class) doesnt wipe the ui fields (fixed by just wiping the entire class instead)
    - When adding a source, it is not added to filter. For example, Tamer class from Heliana's is not visible unless class filter is altered
    - Removing source that a (saved characers) subclass (but not class) depends upon creates FOS loading errors. Temporarily fixed by just wiping entire class instead
    - If character learns light cantrip, then gets a race that adds the light cantrip (like aasimar), then the UI will not allow one to unlearn their first light cantrip, so you will have two (seems fixed?)
    - If you choose sorcerer, then aasimar, Light will be marked as learned in the UI. if you swap race away from aasimar, Light will still be marked as learned, and cannot be unlearned (seems fixed?)
    - Adding sources without removing any, should that really have to wipe class?
WEB:
    - Add UI notifications
    - Test custom urls for content (+ save/load/exportFvtt)
    - Test custom uploaded files for content (+ save/load/exportFvtt)
    - Make sure all used content(classes/races/backgrounds) are turned ON in the filter when a save file is loaded (should be on already, assuming user didnt turn them off in the filter afterwards)
    - Some kind of filter button in Select Sources that sorts sources by active or not, so its easier to toggle off sources you already have enabled
    - Option to favourite sources so you can easily toggle them on/off later
    - Change warning for changing sources so that it says it (MAY) wipe your sheet

CSS:
    - Tidy up as much as possible into a single .css file
    - Rip some of the later css code from a .css file intended for use in foundry (i think it was style.css?)

SERIALIZIATION:
    - Make the cookies or character save file remember filter settings on each of the components?
    - Save json from uploaded homebrew files to a cookie

CHARSELECT:

SHEET:
    - Cantrip attacks (sort of solved with hoverable spell popups)
    - Better attack parsing overall
FEAT:
    - Make spell choices in feats like Fey Touched be save/loaded
    - Also make the choice appear in Sheet view
CLASS:
    - Make subclass dropdown be locked until high enough level
    - Make sure when class is removed, that the Feats menu understands that and doesnt allow feat choices from that class
    - Make sure ASI choices are removed from classes that are marked as removed

EXPORT:
    - Include entities from uploaded homebrew files in export to FVTT

TOCHECK:
    - Removing homebrew content for a subclass that is in sue
    - Removing homebrew content for a class feature that is in use (Warlock pacts)

IDEAS:
- When adding a new source, maybe the filters should auto-turn on for that source?
- Disallow removing sources that are in use, OR include a settings bool that instead just wipes the character when removing a source that is in use

PLAN:
    - Fix bugs that have to do with online sources
    - Disable homebrew sources entirely (for now)
    - Set up popup windows for major errors (specifically source errors) that the user needs to know about
    - Remove character portraits entirely
    - Enable character share functionality (give user a string to copy)
    - Enable character import functionality (let user import string)
    - RELEASE 1 READY
    - Enable FVTT Export functionality
    - RELEASE 2 READY
    
    - OTHER PLANS:
    - Character sheet spell slots counter
    - Source manager UI improvements
