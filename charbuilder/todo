BUGS:
    - Going down in level and then up again will not re-render FOS components (seems fixed)
    - FOS subcomponents are getting their states set even after spells are renderered, even though they should be before (shouldnt be a big issue)
    - verify if url-linked spells on the sheet work for 3rd party homebrew (or your own homebrew)
    - Make save/change sources button not appear in view mode
    - Removing sources in use (for example class) doesnt wipe the ui fields
    - When adding a source, it is not added to filter. For example, Tamer class from Heliana's is not visible unless class filter is altered
    - Same goes when saving, filter is turned off so loaded character doesnt display Tamer as the chosen class
WEB:
    - Add UI notifications
    - Test custom urls for content (+ save/load/exportFvtt)
    - Test custom uploaded files for content (+ save/load/exportFvtt)

CSS:
    - Tidy up as much as possible into a single .css file
    - Rip some of the later css code from a .css file intended for use in foundry (i think it was style.css?)

SERIALIZIATION:
    - Make the cookies or character save file remember filter settings on each of the components?
    - Save json from uploaded homebrew files to a cookie

CHARSELECT:

SHEET:
    - Cantrip attacks (sort of solved with hoverable spell popups)
    - Better attack parsing overall

CLASS:
    - Make subclass dropdown be locked until high enough level
    - Make sure when class is removed, that the Feats menu understands that and doesnt allow feat choices from that class
    - Make sure ASI choices are removed from classes that are marked as removed

EXPORT:
    - Include entities from uploaded homebrew files in export to FVTT
