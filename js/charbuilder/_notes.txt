---SHEET DISPLAY---

Races:
    - Sub-features of races (like natural armor, unarmed strike variations, features that give flying/swimming speed) will all be baked into the race itself, and not exist as independent features on the sheet.

Backgrounds:
    - Sub-features of backgrounds will not be seperately rendered, just like sub-features of races
